# Contributing to OGA Local Service Atlas

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Python 3.12+ (for local development without Docker)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/oga-local-service-atlas.git
   cd oga-local-service-atlas
   ```

2. **Copy environment file**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start services with Docker**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
   - Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/

### Local Development (without Docker)

If you prefer to run without Docker:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Set environment variables (requires PostgreSQL + PostGIS locally)
export DATABASE_URL=postgis://user:password@localhost:5432/oga_atlas
export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# Run migrations and server
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Code Standards

### Linting and Formatting

We use **Ruff** for linting and **Black** for formatting. These are enforced in CI.

```bash
# Check linting
ruff check backend/

# Format code
black backend/

# Or use pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Docker equivalents:

```bash
docker compose exec backend ruff check backend/
docker compose exec backend black --check backend/
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```
feat: add geographic area API endpoints
fix: correct state transition validation in reports
docs: update API documentation for evidence upload
```

### Testing

All new features must include tests. We use pytest with Django and GeoDjango.

Docker (recommended):

```bash
# Run tests
docker compose exec backend pytest -q

# With coverage
docker compose exec backend pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
```

Local (without Docker):

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

Minimum coverage requirement: **70%** for business logic.

GeoDjango tip: match geometry types in tests. `GeographicArea.geometry` is a MultiPolygon—wrap a `Polygon` in `MultiPolygon` when creating areas in tests to avoid type errors.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run checks locally**

   ```bash
   ruff check backend/
   black --check backend/
   pytest
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Link to related issue (e.g., "Closes #12")
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

5. **Review process**
   - At least one peer review required
   - Maintainer approval for merge
   - All CI checks must pass

## Data Model Changes

Changes to data models require:

1. Written justification in the PR description
2. Migration files included
3. Documentation updated in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Tests for new model behavior

## Geographic Data Guidelines

- **No free-text locations**: All locations must reference a `GeographicArea`
- **GeoJSON format**: All spatial data uses GeoJSON (SRID 4326)
- **Validation**: Geographic data must be validated at both API and database levels

## Evidence and Provenance

- All data entries must have `data_source` specified
- Evidence files are hashed for integrity
- Reports require evidence unless flagged as low-confidence

## Phase 2: Ingestion & Harmonization Guidelines

### Official Data Ingestion

- Use `InfrastructureIngester` to parse official datasets (GeoJSON FeatureCollections).
- Always populate provenance on created assets: `data_owner`, `license`, `source_url`, `update_frequency`.
- Preserve original source `properties` as `source_metadata` for auditability.
- If geometry is not a Point, use its centroid for the asset `location`.
- Link assets to the smallest `GeographicArea` that spatially covers the point.
- Add tests for ingestion mapping and edge cases (missing geometry, unknown types).

### Report Harmonization

- Use `HarmonizationService` for matching reports to assets.
- Matching includes spatial proximity, asset type filtering, and optional name similarity (pg_trgm).
- Ensure `pg_trgm` is enabled via migration (already included in the reports app).
- Keep auto-link thresholds conservative; add tests for close, borderline, and far cases.
- Expose unmatched reports via `/api/v1/reports/unmatched/` for manual review.

## API for Contributors

- Browse OpenAPI: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
- Read operations are open; write operations require auth.
- Obtain JWT:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/token/` with `{"username":"<user>","password":"<pass>"}`
  - Use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Useful endpoints:
  - Assets: `/api/v1/infrastructure/assets/`, `/api/v1/infrastructure/assets/geojson/`
  - Reports: `/api/v1/reports/`, `/api/v1/reports/unmatched/`, `/api/v1/reports/geojson/`
